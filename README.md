## dockerfiles

These are some Dockerfiles I have found useful. 

### About

Many of these exist so I can use the containerized version of a tool on a CI worker and not need to worry about remembering to install it or if there will be a version conflict. Others (specifically [bash](https://hub.docker.com/r/jdkelley/bash)), are in response to a few colleagues complaining about the state of gnu tools on their Macs.

I will be adding other containerized tools I regularly use including several GUI-based applications.

You can find most of these built as images and available on dockerhub under [jdkelley](https://hub.docker.com/r/jdkelley). I use these images on a daily basis. Feel free to use them.

If an image doesn't work for you or you have an image you would like added, drop a pull request.
